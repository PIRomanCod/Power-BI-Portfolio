Welcome to my personal Analytic portfolio repository! Here you will find a collection of Power BI, Looker and Fabric projects and dashboards that demonstrate my skills and expertise in data visualization, business intelligence, and analytics using BI tools.

## About Me

I am a meticulous data enthusiast with extensive experience in Power BI (DAX, PQ), Python (Web, DS, ML), and Excel (DAX, PP, VBA). I have over 20 years of data science experience, including transforming raw data into meaningful insights, creating interactive dashboards, and helping companies make data-driven decisions.

This portfolio showcases my mastery of BI and highlights my ability to effectively present complex data visually.

My key area of expertise lies in analyzing and optimizing unit economics, helping businesses understand their cost structures, PnL, ROI, COGS, and other key metrics.

I develop interactive dashboards and models that reveal core drivers of profitability, track operational KPIs, and support decision-making at both tactical and executive levels.

This portfolio highlights my ability to visualize complex metrics across industries such as e-commerce, SaaS, agriculture, and logistics.

My goal is to help companies achieve sustainable growth by making their data work for them — clearly, effectively, and with measurable results.

## Project 2: Store's Marketing Dashboard

<details>
<summary>Dashboard Summary for Marketing Department</summary>

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of key customer and product metrics to inform marketing strategy and sales optimization. Key features include:

Dynamic ABC Analysis: Enables segmentation of customers and products into A, B, and C categories based on contribution metrics (such as revenue or profit), helping identify high-value segments and prioritize marketing efforts.

Basket Analysis: Offers insights into product associations within customer transactions, highlighting commonly co-purchased items. This aids in designing targeted cross-selling strategies and promotions.

Top-N Product Analysis: Tracks the performance of selected top, middle, and bottom-performing products over time, allowing the team to evaluate shifts in product demand and identify opportunities for growth or improvement.

RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a critical tool for businesses aiming to enhance customer relationships and drive revenue growth. By segmenting customers based on their purchasing behavior, organizations can identify high-value customers, tailor marketing strategies, and improve customer retention.

This analysis allows businesses to:

Prioritize Marketing Efforts: Understanding which customers are most engaged helps allocate marketing resources effectively, ensuring that high-value segments receive targeted campaigns.

Enhance Customer Retention: By identifying at-risk customers, businesses can implement strategies to re-engage them, ultimately reducing churn rates.

Optimize Product Offerings: RFM analysis provides insights into customer preferences, enabling companies to adjust their product offerings to better meet demand.

Increase Sales and Revenue: By focusing on loyal and high-value customers, businesses can boost sales through personalized promotions and tailored communication.

Drive Strategic Decision-Making: RFM insights inform broader business strategies, including inventory management, pricing strategies, and customer service enhancements.

In summary, RFM analysis is essential for any organization seeking to improve customer relationships, maximize profitability, and sustain long-term growth in a competitive market.

This dashboard equips the marketing department with actionable data insights, enabling strategic planning and optimized customer engagement efforts.

-   Customer Retention Insights
-   Personalized Marketing
-   Analysis of Marketing Campaigns Performance

Cohort Metrics:

-   Retention Rate
-   Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)
-   Revenue Per Cohort

### Yearly Cohort Analysis

![Yearly Cohort Analysis gif](https://github.com/PIRomanCod/Power-BI-Portfolio/blob/main/src/Yearly%20Cohort%20Analysis.gif)

Further Analysis Metrics:
In addition to exist cohort metrics, the dashboard can be extended with the following indicators for deeper insights:

-   Churn Rate – Measures the percentage of users who stop using the service during a specific time period.

-   Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) – Estimates the total revenue a business can expect from a single customer or cohort throughout their lifecycle.

-   Cohort Growth Rate – Tracks how the size of new user cohorts changes over time, reflecting acquisition trends.

-   Conversion Rate per Cohort – Shows how efficiently each cohort moves through the funnel (e.g., from sign-up to first purchase).

-   Engagement Metrics – Includes session frequency, feature usage, and activity levels to assess user involvement within each cohort.

-   Revenue Retention Rate – Evaluates how much revenue is retained from a cohort over time, accounting for upsells or downgrades.

-   Segmented Cohorts – Cohorts broken down by geography, acquisition channel, or device type to identify patterns in different user segments.

These extended metrics provide a more granular view of customer behavior, enabling better forecasting, segmentation, and product improvement strategies.

## Project 5: Hybrid Public traffic platform for Zaporizhia

<details> <summary>A platform for traffic from scratch for a single city
(Data engineering, Visualizations, Alerts)</summary>

This project was part of the Microsoft DP 700 course and certification exam

Capstone requirements:
Building an automated data collection, transformation, and enrichment system

Using batch and real-time, streaming data sources, visualisations in Real-time Dashboard with low latency

Ability to use the full set of MS Factory tools:
Lakehouse, Dataflow Gen2, Eventstream, KQL, Pipelines, Notebooks, and Power BI

The project processes static historical data and real-time IoT sensor streams, performs ETL transformations, aggregates
and enriches the data, and delivers actionable insights through realtime dashboards.

This project showcases the design and implementation of a Smart City Traffic &
Incident Platform on Microsoft Fabric, demonstrating real-time analytics, batch ETL processing,
and interactive dashboards — all within a unified platform. The solution is extensible, cloudnative, and aligned with modern data engineering best practices, making it ideal for smart city
governance, urban planning, and traffic optimization use cases.
